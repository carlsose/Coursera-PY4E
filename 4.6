Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
Award time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. 
Put the logic to do the computation of time-and-a-half in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation.

def computepay(h,r):
    if h > 40:
        return ((h-40)*(1.5*r)) + (40*r)
    else:
        return h*r

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
rt = input("Enter rate per hour:")
hr = float(hrs)
rt = float(rt)

p = computepay(hr,rt)
print(p)
